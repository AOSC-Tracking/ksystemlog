Specific Trouble case with KSystemLog
===================================================
I hope that you will don't have any problems to compile and test KSystemLog.
If you successfully compile KSystemLog but you have strange problems (with the
tool bars, please manually copy src/ksystemlogui.rc in the $HOME/.kde/share/apps/ksystemlog
folder (create it if it does not exist).

If you still have problems, do not hesitate do email me ;-)

Source Package Creation
==================================================
Retrieve the svn2dist tool at :
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdesdk/scripts

Then, once it is downloaded, launch the following command :

svn2dist playground/sysadmin/ ksystemlog -v 0.3.3 -l --no-gzip

- "playground/sysadmin" is the folder where ksystemlog is located, but it is also the path to the doc and localization in the KDE SVN tree. 
- "ksystemlog" is the folder of the project, but also the name of it

Basic Installation
===================================================

cmake .
make
make install
